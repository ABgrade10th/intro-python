# 7. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a car speed detection system.
# the car company would like to create a function where if the user goes over a certain
# speed it will notify them to change gears. The client has provided you with the following
# guidelines on how they would like the gear system to work:
# if the driver is going over 20mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 1
# if the the driver is going over 30mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 2
# if the driver is going over 40mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 3
# if the driver is going over 70mph, alert the driver to shift back to gear 1.
# the client would like you to pass in the speed that the user is going as an argument. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

I think they should get full credit because they all going fast to get credit and to trying out new cars. Everytime they go fast they have to shift the gear and when they shift the gear they gotta go to 1, 2, 3, then go back to 1.

They should get full credit because the way they cook and the way they wash the dishes after eating. In the morning they eat breakfast that should be a 100% good meal. Then in the afternoon like around 5 or 6 they should eat something good and it should be a 100% good meal too. In the morning they eat 2 eggs and an apple then monday afernoon they eat a bbq grilled chicken and broccoli that's good that's what they need.

# 10. Create a function that will check the temperature outside. If the user enters
# a number above 60 degrees it is warm outside, if the enter a number above 80 degrees it is hot outside.
# if the user enters a number below 50 degrees it is cold outside. and if the tempeature is above 50 degrees,
# tell the user it's not warm but it's also not too cold. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

It was hot but then it got cold so they change the tempeature if they didn't change it and it was cold people would of been feezing in the room and being mad because nobody was in there to change it if it was hot people would of been soo mad because its soo hot
