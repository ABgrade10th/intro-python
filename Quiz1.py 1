#1. what built-in fucntion would you use if you wanted
# to print out data to a user? 

I would use the Print() Fucntion.'

#2 what built-1 fucntion would you use if wanted
# a user to pass in data to progrom?


#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, them
#provide an example describing their relatinship to one another.
# You cannot use the following example because they
# were shared in class grocery/ electronics store, car, photos.

"complexity = is the measure of how resource intensive a'
'program can be; example are power, memory, storange.'
'Abstraction = Is the proces of hiding the operations in the 
'background, or simplifying operations.'

#4 what does it mean when you encounter a syntax error?

'the computer doesnt understand our code because it'
'not conforming to the language rules.

#5 what is a variable? Provide an example of a variable in
'A variable is a container for data.'example strings, floats, number, etc.'


x = 10

Print(2 + x = 5)

#6. write a function in python that when called will print out 
# your name.

name = 'Abdul-Baaqee'
print(name)

Print('Abudl')

def nameFunction():

nameFunction

 #7. what is a fucntion definition and a fucntion call?

 'Fucntion definition = A set of instruction'
 'that will only run when the fucntion name is called'

 'Fucntion call = The execution of the function instruction.

 #8. Describe what each sybol means?

 # = // single equal
 # --> Assogning a value to a key. example # variable and data
 #==?? Duoble equal -->

 #syntaxError
 # typeError (data type error) -> canont add a string to an integer

 # 12 what are the three (3) naming formats we use for naming variable

'Snake case - we add a undeerscore after every word'.

'Pascal case - every word starts with a capital letter'

'Camel case - every word after the first word' 
'start with a capital letter'


# !3 Provide a coding scenario where you would you use 
# a comparison operator in a program?
'Comparing numbers : ==, >,<'
'Comparing != : do/dont these passwords match.'


# 14. provide a coding scenario where
# you would you use a logical operator in a program?
'and, or, not: logical operations'

# 15. Create a block of code where you would
# use a comparison operator with the following data:
currentScore= 100
highScore=2300

currentScore != highScore
